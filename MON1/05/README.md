A bash script was written. The script is run with a single parameter.

The parameter is an absolute or relative path to a directory. The parameter must end with '/', for example:
script05.sh /var/log/

The script outputs the following information about the directory specified in the parameter:
- Total number of folders, including subfolders
- Top 5 folders with largest size in descending order (path and size)
- Total number of files
- Number of configuration files (with .conf extension), text files, executable files, log files (files with .log extension), archives, symbolic links
- Top 10 files with largest size in descending order (path, size and type)
- Top 10 executable files with largest size in descending order (path, size and hash)
- Execution time of the script

The script should output the following information:

Total number of folders (including all nested ones) = 6  
TOP 5 folders of maximum size arranged in descending order (path and size):  
1 - /var/log/one/, 100 GB  
2 - /var/log/two/, 100 MB  
etc up to 5
Total number of files = 30
Number of:  
Configuration files (with the .conf extension) = 1 
Text files = 10  
Executable files = 5
Log files (with the extension .log) = 2  
Archive files = 3  
Symbolic links = 4  
TOP 10 files of maximum size arranged in descending order (path, size and type):  
1 - /var/log/one/one.exe, 10 GB, exe  
2 - /var/log/two/two.log, 10 MB, log  
etc up to 10  
TOP 10 executable files of the maximum size arranged in descending order (path, size and MD5 hash of file)  
1 - /var/log/one/one.exe, 10 GB, 3abb17b66815bc7946cefe727737d295  
2 - /var/log/two/two.exe, 9 MB, 53c8fdfcbb60cf8e1a1ee90601cc8fe2  
etc up to 10  
Script execution time (in seconds) = 1.5
